# Why This Portfolio Is Like This

Every developer portfolio is a statement about what you care about. Most of them say "I know Tailwind and can center a div." I wanted mine to say something different.

This site is a Next.js 14 app with a 3D interactive keyboard built in Spline, GSAP-driven scroll animations, Framer Motion page transitions, ambient Pokemon soundtrack, particle effects, a command palette, keyboard shortcuts, and a custom crosshair cursor. It is objectively over-engineered for a portfolio. That was the point.

## The 3D Keyboard

The skills section has an interactive 3D keyboard model loaded via `@splinetool/react-spline`. Each keycap maps to a technology I work with. The model is preloaded in the document head to avoid the visual pop-in:

```html
<link rel="preload" href="/assets/skills-keyboard.spline" as="fetch" crossOrigin="anonymous" />
```

The keyboard also has sound. Click a key and you hear a mechanical keypress. The `useSounds` hook manages an `AudioContext` and plays samples from `/assets/keycap-sounds/`. It's completely unnecessary and I love it.

## Scroll Animations

Lenis handles smooth scrolling. GSAP handles the scroll-triggered animations — section headers that slide in, text that fades up, elements that parallax. Framer Motion handles component-level animations like hover states and page transitions.

Using both GSAP and Framer Motion sounds redundant, but they solve different problems. GSAP is better for scroll-driven orchestration where you need precise timeline control. Framer Motion is better for declarative component animations that tie into React's lifecycle. Trying to do everything in one or the other would have been messier.

## The Music

There's ambient background music. 24 curated tracks from the Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald soundtrack, shuffled on each visit, auto-playing after the first user interaction. FLAC format because I'm not compressing Littleroot Town to 128kbps MP3.

It plays at 30% volume. There's no mute button. This is my portfolio and Dewford Town deserves to be heard.

Safari doesn't support FLAC, so the hook checks `canPlayType("audio/flac")` and silently does nothing if it fails. Safari users get silence, which is its own kind of statement.

## The Command Palette

`Ctrl+K` opens a command palette. It lets you jump to any section, open external links, and navigate the site without scrolling. The keyboard shortcuts overlay shows all available bindings.

## The Animated Background

The background is a custom particle system rendered on canvas. Particle count adapts to viewport size — 80 on desktop, 40 on mobile. The crosshair cursor replaces the default pointer on desktop. Both are disabled on mobile because touch devices don't have hover states and particles eat battery.

## Config-Driven Everything

All personal data lives in three files: `config.ts` (name, email, socials), `constants.ts` (skills, experience), and `projects.tsx` (portfolio projects). Everything else reads from these. Change your name in one place, it updates everywhere. GitHub stats, activity feeds, and the progress tracker all pull from `config.githubUsername`.

## The Color Scheme

Dark background (#0A0A0A) with gold (#C9A84C) accents. Luxury watch aesthetic. The gold has three variants — light for hover states, dim for borders, muted for backgrounds. It reads as premium without being gaudy. Every accent color in the site is a shade of gold.

## The Tradeoff

This portfolio took longer than most production apps I've shipped. A simpler site would have been perfectly fine for job applications. But I wanted a playground — somewhere to use 3D models, scroll animations, ambient audio, binary parsers, and WebAssembly emulators in the same codebase without a product manager asking why.

The result is a portfolio that's fun to browse, technically interesting to dig into, and demonstrates that I build things because I think they're cool, not just because a ticket told me to.
